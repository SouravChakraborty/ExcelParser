# ExcelParser
This project contains a custom parser for reading Microsoft Excel files. It accepts both 'xls' and 'xlsx' file extensions. 

This utility program uses the Apache POI library to parse input excel files. The output of this program is a Java Map which contains row-wise data, with every data mapped to its corresponding column attribute.
